## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lavleshgarg/lavleshgarg.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

[ServiceNow Operation Manual](../NBSA/servicenow-operation-manual.md)

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Alt-H1
==
Alt-H2
------

### Emphasis

**Bold is between pair of 2 astricks**  

*italic is between pair of 1 astrick*  
_or pair of underscores_

~~strikethrough is a pair of 2 tildes~~


### Lists

- bulleted List
- item 2
- item 3


1. order list
  * unordered List
  * star works
  - minus works as well
  + plus too
2. item 2
  1. ordered sub list
  2. more items
4. actual number doesn't matter  
   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown)  

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behavior, where trailing spaces are not required.)
5. one more item   

### Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-sytle link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

### Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.
```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lavleshgarg/lavleshgarg.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
