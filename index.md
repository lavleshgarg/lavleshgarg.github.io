## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lavleshgarg/lavleshgarg.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Alt-H1
==
Alt-H2
--

- bulleted List
- item 2
- item 3

**Bold is between pair of 2 astricks**

*italic is between pair of 1 astrick*
_or pair of underscores_

~~strikethrough is a pair of 2 tildes~~


1. order list
  * unordered List
  * star works
  - minus works as well
  + plus too
2. item 2
  1. ordered sub list
  2. more items
4. actual number doesn't matter  
   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown)
   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
5. one more item

Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lavleshgarg/lavleshgarg.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
